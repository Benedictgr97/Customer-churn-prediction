# Kaggle-intermediate-machine-learning
Predicting customer churn for Telco customers, another dataset that was found on Kaggle.

Used a range of topics from the course including one hot encoding and dealing with missing values.
A range of different models and techniques were used to find the minimum f1_score for the dataset.
F1_score was used to as precision and recall optimisation would depend on how customers would be incentivised to stay after being identified.
Precision would be better for me expensive incentives and recall used for cheaper ones.
The most usefull parameters for churn prediction were also identified with the columns that had the greatest decrease in f1_score when they were removed from the model.
