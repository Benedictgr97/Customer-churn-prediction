# Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
To set up the environment for this project, ensure you have Python 3.11 installed. You can install the required packages using `pip`. Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Benedictgr97/Customer-churn-prediction.git
    cd Customer-churn-prediction
    ```
2. **Install the packages from requirments file**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Project Motivation<a name="ProjectMotivation"></a>
To understand why customers choose to leave a contract or service, gaining deeper insights into their decision-making process.
1. Predictive Accuracy: How well can customer churn be predicted using the available factors?
2. Model Performance: Which model achieves the best F1 score for predicting churn?
3. Baseline Comparison: Is the modelâ€™s performance better than random guessing?
4. Contributing Factors: What factors contribute the most to customer churn?
5. Optimal Solutions: Can an optimal package be developed to reduce customer churn?

# File descriptions <a name="FileDescriptions"></a>
There are 3 files above used for this project with inly 2 required if you have the right prerequisites installed

**Teleco customer churn.ipynb** - The main script used to predict churn, test the optimal model and understand the factors that affect churn.<br />
**WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv** The customer churn data.<br />
**requirements.txt** requirements file used for the above. Not needed if you already have the prerequisites. <br />
